Hi! I'm Weiyan Hu, and I'm a senior (class of 2022) studying Computer Science at Purdue University.

## Interests

My interests lie in Android Development and low level system knowledge. I love to plan things ahead and actively finding out my weaknesses. I am very willing to listen to other people's critiques and think hard to fix them.

I love reading books before bed, which helped me to look at things at different perspectives and cleared my mind. The books I am recently reading are [non-violent communication](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Changing-Relationships/dp/189200528X) and [Deep Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692)

I love doing work out. I believe having a good health will help me have a good mood and an active mind. I loved all kinds of Sports, including basketball, football and F1. I am a loyal New Orleans Pelicans fan and a Mclaren Fan.
