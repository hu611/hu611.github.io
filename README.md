Libraries I used (the reason you're probably here):

- [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
- [GitHub Octocat corner](http://tholman.com/github-corners/)
- [pranavkumar.me](https://pranavkumar.me)

Enter the following lines in terminal and it should be good to go:
gem install github-pages
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
